- Group similar options in help (e.g. options about branch lengths)
- Unit Tests (a general test suite)
- More details in INSTALL file
  to help users!!!
- For cmake, need a CMakeLists.txt example file with other compilers
- Add an option to deal with different genetic code
  and maybe user own genetic code file
- Could we deal with Selenocystein and other "new" Amino acids?
- Display estimated tree (not only branch lengths) in default
  output
- Promote FastCodeML in Bio* packages:
  BioPerl, BioPython, BioJava, BioRuby


Open questions:
- Test if FastCodeML can avoid leaf computation
- Test what FastCodeML does with branch around root (pseudoroot)?
  Does it compute only one of them in rooted tree case?
- How to force H0 computation if H1 is not significant?
