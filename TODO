- Unit Tests (a general test suite)
- More details in INSTALL file
  to help users!!!
- Do a complete FastCodeML run on Primates to compare it
  large scale with Primate SlimCodeml run
- Add an option to deal with different genetic code
  and maybe user own genetic code file
- Display estimated tree (not only branch lengths) in default
  output
- Promote FastCodeML in Bio* packages:
  BioPerl, BioPython, BioJava, BioRuby


Open questions:
- Test if FastCodeML can avoid leaf computation
- Test what FastCodeML does with branch around root (pseudoroot)?
  Does it comput only one of them in rooted tree case?
- How to force H0 computation if H1 is not significative?
- dos2unix all files?
