REQUIREMENTS to generate the executable:
* C++ compiler, e.g. GCC 4
* CMake 2.8.0 (including ccmake) or later recommended, although compilation possible without
* Boost::Spirit 1.42.0 or later recommended, see http://boost-spirit.com/home/
* Reasonably new BLAS implementation (e.g. OpenBLAS, Goto2, ACML, MKL)
	packages from various Linux distributions can be used, but this deteriorates performance
	recommended: OpenBLAS (http://xianyi.github.io/OpenBLAS/) or Intel MKL
* Reasonably new LAPACK library (e.g. original LAPACK or ACML, MKL)
	packages from various Linux distributions can be used, but this deteriorates performance


INSTALLATION: How to generate the FastCodeML executable:
0)
* Generate BLAS, if necessary
	Download OpenBLAS from https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/
		make USE_THREAD=0 USE_OPENMP=1 (together are contradictiory. on macos use_openmp=1 doesnt work even with ggc)
		make PREFIX=path/to/installation/blas install
* Generate LAPACK, if necessary
	Download LAPACK from http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
	Take the gfortran version of the makefile:
		cp INSTALL/make.inc.gfortran ./make.inc
	In the make.inc file set BLASLIB to the full path to the generated BLAS
		e.g. BLASLIB = path/to/installation/blas/lib/libopenblas.a
	run $make
	Two libraries will be created: lapack.a and tmglib.a. 
	We put them inside a folder and merge them:
		unpack in a new directory
			ar x liblapack.a
			ar x tmglib.a
		merge all produced object files into a new LAPACK library
			ar rcs liblapack.a *.o
		copy the liblapack.a into the library folder (e.g. /usr/local/lib)	
* Generate NLopt library, if necessary
	Download NLopt from http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt
	Install it
		./configure --prefix=path/to/installation/nlopt
		make USE_THREAD=0 (why equal to 0 ?)
		make install
* Generate BOOST library (>= 1.42.0), if necessary
	Download BOOST from http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/latest/download?source=files
	Install it (to change the compiler is not so trivial)
		./bootstrap.sh --prefix=path/to/installation/boost
		./b2 install
* Generate MPI library, if necessary
	Download MPI from http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/
	Install it
		./configure --prefix=path/to/installation/mpi
		make
		make install

1)
* Open FastCodeML tarball
	tar xvfz FastCodeML-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
	cd FastCodeML-X.Y.Z/
* Edit CMakeLists.txt to enable/disable (ON/OFF) optimization libraries (in "Get the configuration switches" section)
  switch USE_MPI and USE_OPENMP ON/OFF (other default settings should be ok -> original prop = on)
* Set paths for libraries (change and execute SETPATHS) (use only what you require)
    BLAS_LIB_DIR       = path/to/installation/blas/lib
    LAPACK_LIB_DIR     = path/to/installation/blas/include
    MKL_INCLUDE_DIR    = path/to/installation/mkl/include
    NLOPT_INCLUDE_DIR  = path/to/installation/nlopt/includemak
    NLOPT_LIB_DIR      = path/to/installation/nlopt/lib
    MATH_LIB_NAMES     = "openblas;lapack;gfortranbegin;gfortran"
* Build executable
    ccmake . 
    (on mac: g++ compiler for c++ code and gcc compiler for c code OR use -lstdc++ option with gcc OR with clang)
    make
    (linking issue with lapack, mkl,mpi library set to on)
* An executable "fast" is created

Computer system:
* Linux preferred, but sources are portable to other platforms
