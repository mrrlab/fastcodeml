REQUIREMENTS:

* Computer system:
    Linux preferred, but sources are portable to other platforms
* C++ compiler, e.g. GCC 4
* CMake 2.8.0 (including ccmake) or later recommended, although compilation possible without
* Boost::Spirit library 1.42.0 or later recommended, see http://boost-spirit.com/home/
* Reasonably new BLAS library (e.g. OpenBLAS, Goto2, ACML, MKL)
	packages from various Linux distributions can be used, but this deteriorates performance
	recommended: OpenBLAS (http://xianyi.github.io/OpenBLAS/) or Intel MKL
* Reasonably new LAPACK library (e.g. original LAPACK or ACML, MKL)
	packages from various Linux distributions can be used, but this deteriorates performance
* Nlopt library (see http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt)
* MPI library (see http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/)	

INSTALLATION: 

1-Prepring libraries:

* Generate BLAS, if necessary
	Download OpenBLAS from https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/
		make USE_OPENMP=1
		make PREFIX=path/to/installation/blas install

* Generate LAPACK, if necessary
	Download LAPACK from http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
	Take the gfortran version of the makefile:
		cp INSTALL/make.inc.gfortran ./make.inc
	In the make.inc file set BLASLIB to the full path to the generated BLAS
		e.g. BLASLIB = path/to/installation/blas/lib/libopenblas.a
	Run $make
	Two libraries will be created: lapack.a and tmglib.a. 
	Put them inside a folder and merge them:
		unpack in a new directory
			ar x liblapack.a
			ar x tmglib.a
		merge all produced object files into a new LAPACK library
			ar rcs liblapack.a *.o
		copy the liblapack.a into the library folder	
		
* Generate NLopt library, if necessary
	Download NLopt from http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt
	Install it
		./configure --prefix=path/to/installation/nlopt
		make 
		make install
		
* Generate BOOST library (>= 1.42.0), if necessary
	Download BOOST from http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/latest/download?source=files
	Install it
		./bootstrap.sh --prefix=path/to/installation/boost
		./b2 install
		
* Generate MPI library, if necessary
	Download MPI from http://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/
	Install it
		./configure --prefix=path/to/installation/mpi
		make
		make install

2-Generating executable:

* Open FastCodeML tarball
	tar xvfz FastCodeML-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
	cd FastCodeML-X.Y.Z/
	
* Edit CMakeLists.txt to enable/disable (ON/OFF) optimization libraries (in "Get the configuration switches" section)

* Set paths for required libraries (using export)
    BLAS_LIB_DIR       = path/to/installation/blas/lib
    LAPACK_LIB_DIR     = path/to/installation/lapack/lib
    MKL_INCLUDE_DIR    = path/to/installation/mkl/include

    NLOPT_LIB_DIR      = path/to/installation/nlopt/lib
    MATH_LIB_NAMES     = "openblas;lapack;gfortranbegin;gfortran"

* Build executable
    ccmake . 
    make
     
* An executable "fast" is created
